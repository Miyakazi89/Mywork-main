            <h2>What Is Cybersecurity?</h2>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are typically aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

            <h2>Why Is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
            <p>
                In today's connected world, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Cyber threats can impact individuals, businesses, and governments. They can lead to financial loss, data breaches, damage to reputation, and, in some cases, national security concerns. As more devices are connected and more personal data is stored online, the need for strong cybersecurity measures grows exponentially.

        <!-- Common Cyber Attacks Section -->
        <div class="cyberattack-list">
            <h2>Common Cyber Attacks:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.</li>
                <li><strong>DDoS Attacks:</strong> Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks aim to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target with a flood of Internet traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.</li>
                <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Software specifically designed to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to a computer or network. This includes viruses, worms, spyware, and trojans.</li>
                <li><strong>Spoofing:</strong> The act of impersonating another user, device, or system to gain unauthorized access or deceive people. Common examples include email spoofing and IP address spoofing.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Attacks:</strong> Attempts to obtain or crack a user's password. These attacks can include brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks:</strong> IoT devices, such as smart home devices and sensors, are vulnerable to attacks because they often lack security protections, providing an entry point for cybercriminals.</li>
                <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Similar to DDoS, DoS attacks flood a network or server with traffic, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. In a DoS attack, the attack is usually carried out by a single source.</li>
            </ul>
